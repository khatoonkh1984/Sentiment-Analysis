Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis referred to as opinion mining, is an approach to natural language processing that identifies the emotional tone behind a body of text. It is a popular way for organizations to determine and categorize opinions about a product, service, or idea. It involves the use of data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to mine text for sentiment and subjective information. I use LSTM networks to address the vanishing gradients and long-term dependence of RNNs. Gradient vanishing refers to the loss of information in a neural network as connections recur over a longer period. In simple words, LSTM tackles gradient vanishing by ignoring useless data/information in the network.
